# ðŸ§¬ End-to-End Workflow to Preprocess and Submit Annotation Files to NCBI Using [table2asn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/table2asn/)


This repository contains a complete workflow and set of toolsâ€”including Python scriptsâ€”for preprocessing genome annotation files to ensure compatibility with NCBIâ€™s submission requirements via table2asn. The workflow includes:

1- Proper formatting of annotation files

2- Bug fixing and validation cleanup

3- Generation of NCBI-compliant feature table (.tbl) and FASTA files

4- Naming and standardization of gene and protein features

5- Resolving validation errors and optimizing locus tag annotations

This toolkit enables accurate and efficient submission of annotated genome assemblies to GenBank through NCBIâ€™s table2asn utility.
